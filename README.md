# Sales-Forecasting
The project begins with a crucial data cleaning and preprocessing phase, where missing values in columns like Item_Weight and Outlet_Size are handled and categorical data, specifically Item_Fat_Content, is standardized for consistency. It then creates new features, such as deriving the Outlet_Years from the establishment year and grouping items into New_Item_Type categories. Following the cleaning process, the project moves into exploratory data analysis, using distribution plots to visualize sales data and understand its characteristics. Ultimately, the project's code demonstrates the essential first steps of a data science workflow, from raw data to a clean,well-understood dataset ready for a machine learning model to perform sales forecasting.
